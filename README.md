Use different levels of explanation
Offer multiple formats
## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
Use feedback
pay attention to their querries
## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Use visuals
Provide step by step instructions
## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
It ensures that your information is clear
## 6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?
